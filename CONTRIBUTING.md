## Development Process

We use GitHub Flow, so all changes happen through pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Write or update tests if needed
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Issue a pull request

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-webvtt-export`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/subtitle-timing-issue`)
- `docs/` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/optimize-parser`)
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes (e.g., `test/add-player-tests`)

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript

```javascript
// Use meaningful variable names
const subtitleDuration = endTime - startTime; // ‚úÖ
const d = e - s; // ‚ùå

// Use async/await over promises
async function loadSubtitles() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchSubtitles();
    return parseSubtitles(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to load subtitles:', error);
  }
}

// Document complex functions
/**
 * Converts subtitle time format to milliseconds
 * @param {string} time - Time in format "00:00:00,000"
 * @returns {number} Time in milliseconds
 */
function timeToMs(time) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use CSS modules or styled-components
- Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Ensure responsive design
- Support both dark and light themes

### Git Commits

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
feat: add keyboard shortcuts for subtitle navigation
fix: resolve timing drift in long videos
docs: update API configuration guide
style: improve mobile layout for editor
refactor: optimize subtitle parsing performance
test: add tests for VTT export functionality
```

Format: `<type>: <subject>`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- subtitle-parser.test.js

# Check code coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when modifying existing features
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test edge cases

Example:
```javascript
describe('SubtitleParser', () => {
  test('should parse valid SRT format', () => {
    const srt = '1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000\nHello World';
    const result = parseSRT(srt);
    expect(result[0].text).toBe('Hello World');
    expect(result[0].startTime).toBe(0);
    expect(result[0].endTime).toBe(5000);
  });

  test('should handle empty input', () => {
    expect(parseSRT('')).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```
